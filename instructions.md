# Salon Appointment Scheduler

## Instructions

Follow the instructions and get all the user stories below to pass to finish the project. Create your database by logging in to psql with:

```bash
psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=postgres
```

You can query the database in your script with the command below, add more flags if you need to. Be sure to get creative, and have fun!:

```bash
psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=salon -c "SQL QUERY HERE"
```

Don't forget to connect to your database to add tables after you create it 😄

## Hints

- Your script needs to finish running after doing any of the tasks described below or the tests won't pass
- The tests check the script output so don't use clear or other commands which might erase it
- See examples.txt for example output of a passing script
- The tests may add data to your database, feel free to delete it

## Notes

If you leave your virtual machine, your database may not be saved. You can make a dump of it by entering:

```bash
pg_dump -cC --inserts -U freecodecamp salon > salon.sql
```

in a bash terminal (not the psql one). It will save the commands to rebuild your database in salon.sql. The file will be located where the command was entered. If it's anything inside the project folder, the file will be saved in the VM. You can rebuild the database by entering

```bash
psql -U postgres < salon.sql
```

... in a terminal where the .sql file is.

If you are saving your progress on freeCodeCamp.org, after getting all the tests to pass, follow the instructions above to save a dump of your database. Save the salon.sql file, as well as the final version of your salon.sh file, in a public repository and submit the URL to it on freeCodeCamp.org.
